Snake

Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a simple snake game.

Instructions:
Using arrow keys, navigate the snake around the grid, eating the apples as they appear. Each time you eat an apple the snake will grow longer and get faster.  You must avoid hitting the walls, or the body of the snake.
